Natural Sublime Text Plugin
===========================

This is a Sublime Text plugin for Software AG's Natural, Cobol's ugly,
reatarded, babbling cousin. Made with <3 for those poor souls who — like me —
must endure the abhorrence on their day jobs.

May it inifinitesimally diminish your suffering.

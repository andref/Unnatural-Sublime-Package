Unnatural: Natural (Software AG) Sublime Text Package
=====================================================

This is a Sublime Text plugin for [Software AG Natural][natural], Cobol's
ugly, brain-damaged, BABBLING IN ALL-CAPS ‚Äî but regrettably still healthy and
strong ‚Äî cousin.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for those poor souls who ‚Äî like me ‚Äî must endure the abhorrence on
their day jobs. May it inifinitesimally diminish your suffering.
